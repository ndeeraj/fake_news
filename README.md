# Fake news detection

We have followed two approaches for building models to detect fake news.

## Approach 1: Feature engineering

- featurize_data.ipynb: generates features for the dataset.
- models_logr_svm_rf.ipynb: trains logistic regression, SVMs, Random forest models on the features.
- model_feedforward.ipynb: trains a feedforward neural network on the features.

## Approach 2: Using DistilBERT for classification

- src/fake_news/bert/train.py: trains the pretrained transformer on the classification task.â€‹
